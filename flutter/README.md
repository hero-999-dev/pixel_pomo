# 🍅 Pixel Pomo — Flutter port (iOS + Android)

This folder is the **cross-platform port** of the native Android app (in `../app`). One Dart
codebase builds **both** an Android APK and an **iOS `.ipa`**, so iPhone is finally covered.

## Why it's structured this way

Only the **portable** parts live here and are committed:

```

The generated **`ios/`** and **`android/`** Xcode/Gradle projects are **not** committed — the CI
workflow regenerates them on a macOS runner with `flutter create`, then restores these files and
builds. That keeps the repo small and avoids hand-maintaining platform scaffolding.

## Getting the builds

Push to `main` (touching `flutter/**`) or run the **Build Flutter (iOS + Android)** workflow.
It publishes to the **`latest-flutter`** prerelease:

- **Android:** `pixel_pomo_flutter.apk` — install directly (distinct app id `com.pixelpomo.pixel_pomo`, so it coexists with the native build).
- **iOS:** `pixel_pomo_ios.ipa` — **unsigned**; sideload with **SideStore/AltStore**, which signs it on-device (no Mac needed).

## Building locally (optional)

Needs the Flutter SDK (this repo is validated against **Flutter 3.44.2 / Dart 3.12.2**) plus,
for Android, **Android SDK 36 + build-tools 36** (`sdkmanager "platforms;android-36"
"build-tools;36.0.0"`). From this folder:

```bash
flutter create --org com.pixelpomo --project-name pixel_pomo --platforms=ios,android .
git checkout -- pubspec.yaml lib && rm -f test/widget_test.dart analysis_options.yaml
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test       # logic_test.dart + engine_test.dart + widget_smoke_test.dart (42)
flutter run        # or: flutter build apk / flutter build ios --no-codesign
```

> **Low-RAM note:** the generated `android/gradle.properties` requests `-Xmx8G`, which can crash
> the Gradle daemon on memory-constrained machines. Cap it in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`
> (`GRADLE_USER_HOME`), e.g. `org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2560m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=768m` and
> `org.gradle.daemon=false` — this overrides the template and survives `flutter create`.

## Status / parity

Faithful port of v0.5.0: timer + sessions, 5 themes, focus labels with colors, stats (month
navigator + bar/line/pie charts), coins + shop with localized flowers, 6 languages, and the
first-launch test fixture (1000 coins + sample history). The pure logic is shared test-for-test
with the Kotlin original.

**Flutter-exclusive garden** (richer than the native grid): a **full-screen, portrait, 2.5D world**
drawn by a tiny custom engine (`lib/engine/`) — no Unity/Flame. A **rectangular `cols × rows` claimed
plot (starts 4×6)** is the grass **clearing**; the **forest fills the rest of the screen** — the painter
stamps a tree billboard on every visible tile outside the plot (grounded with a contact shadow), so the
woods cover the screen at any pan/zoom with no void. **EXPAND grows the plot from the center** (+2 ring,
no cap), eating into the woods. The tilt is fixed, but you can **rotate by hand** (two-finger twist),
**pinch-zoom (1×–4×) and pan/roam** the surrounding forest. **CUSTOMIZE** shows tile gridlines.
**Lighting is flat sky-ambient** — nothing is shaded by view angle. Roads lie flat; **fences are real
low-poly 3D** — upright post meshes (brighter sky-lit top) joined by **raised 3D rails** to any
adjacent fence (wood↔dark↔stone), keeping a solid footprint from every angle; a fence can stand **on
top of a road** (flowers can't). **Flowers and forest trees are flat billboards** (depth-sorted);
**only critters** (tiny **bee/butterfly/ladybug**) use an 8-direction atlas to face their heading,
drifting in to **visit a flower** then leaving. The SHOP sells **4 road** + **3 fence** materials
(5 coins each). The wallet shows a **plain 2D gold coin**.

**Peek, camera & wallpaper:** a bottom-left **peek** button hides *all* HUD (full-bleed, system bars
matched); a **camera mode** frames + **screenshots** the garden (`RepaintBoundary` → PNG). The shot →
**SET AS LIVE WALLPAPER** (sets the Android home-screen wallpaper via `wallpaper_manager_flutter`,
Android-only — hidden on iOS), **set as the garden's static backdrop** (`path_provider`), or **save/share**
(`share_plus`). **Settings → HOME SCREEN `CLEAN | GARDEN`** renders the full-strength **live** garden behind
the timer (scrim only behind the text). On-scene HUD icons sit on themed chips so they recolor with the theme
and stay visible. *(True animated OS live wallpaper is a future version; iOS keeps Save/Share.)*

**Theming & stats:** the **status + navigation bars match the theme** (`SystemChrome`) and the **white tap
ripple is gone** (`NoSplash`). **Labels can be renamed** (long-press; migrates color/selection/past stats).
**Stats** has a **DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY/YEARLY/ALL-TIME** period selector that all charts redraw for; the **pie**
has slice separators, the **line is tappable** (callout: bucket + total + per-label), and **DAILY** draws one
line per label. The SHOP sells **4 road** + **3 fence** materials (5 coins each); the wallet is a plain 2D coin.

Korean uses the bundled **Galmuri11** pixel font (OFL, scaled up). The launcher icon is regenerated via
`flutter_launcher_icons` so the pixel tomato survives scaffolding.
